l=2 
b=3
h=4
vol of cuboid= (l*b*h)
vol of cube=(l*b*h)
vol of sphere= 4 pi r2
vol of cylinder = pi r2 h
vol of cone= 1/3 pi r2 h


algorithm

see that in each of the volume formulas , first if the volume is divisible by h , then it may be a cone, cylinder , cube  or cuboid.
But if not divided, it means the vol is being calculated for sphere.
//first import maths module to use pi value
if(vol % h == 0){
     if (vol % pi){
    }
}
